2019 [Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Course Recommendation in MOOCs](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/3815)

# Algorithm name
HRL

# Reproducibility
According to the original README file in the paper repository:

1. Create and activate the Anaconda environemnt 
```bash
➜ conda env create -f rs_survey_tensorflow1.yml
➜ conda activate rs_survey_tensorflow1
```

2. Download the dataset from [here](http://moocdata.cn/data/course-recommendation) and extract the data.
   
3. Move the Data subfloder into the HRL directory

4. To run the code:
```bash
➜ python Train.py
```

We are not able to run the code due to errors in the dataset read process.
